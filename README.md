# TLS-Malware-Detection-with-Machine-Learning

Repository containing code for cleaning of TLS flows extracted from Cisco Joy telemetry tool. Cleaned TLS flows are extracted and written to .csv file before machine learning classifiers 
are applied. Based on the research of Olivier Roques (https://github.com/ojroques/tls-malware-detection) and Cisco (https://blogs.cisco.com/security/detecting-encrypted-malware-traffic-without-decryption)
